However, the future can be altered, Homo Deus wants to join forces with Homo Sapiens to change their fate. Using the last source of energy, Homo Deus successfully opened a time portal and proceeded to send giant fighting machines, called Mecha, to the present world.</p>
<p>The fate of humanity is in your hands. Could you create the strongest Mechas and save the future?</p>
<p>Become the Mech Master!</p>

We want you to experience the world of Mech Master that we have envisioned for a long time, a world where you can command a whole giant Mecha army to fight for humanity. They are YOUR Mechas, and there&#x2019;s proof of that.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-will-like-mech-master--mech-master-is-a-special-game"><strong>Why You Will Like Mech Master / Mech Master Is A Special Game</strong></h2>
<p>You can earn money by playing with cats, with soccer players, with cute little creatures&#x2026; but now, you have the chance to earn BIG money battling HUMONGOUS GIANT FREAKIN ROBOTS.</p>
<p>If you like to command a whole squad of huge Mechas to fight and earn real money simultaneously, then yes, welcome to our game - Mech Master.</p>

<p>Who doesn&#x2019;t want to see a big cannon that can blast right through your enemies from 50 thousand light-years away, a giant sword that slices through metal like butter, or an energy bomb that deals like 10 billion damages to an entire screen worth of mechas? Mech Master is all of those, and much much more.</p>
