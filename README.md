# Introduction

## The story

Assemble the greatest Mecha army the World has ever seen to save the future!

Future Earth inhabitants \(Homo Deus\) sent a message back to the present people \(Homo Sapiens\): "SOS, save our world".

In the near future, Earth will be invaded by many foreign threats. After years of struggle, humanity is on the verge of extinction. However, the future can be altered, Homo Deus wants to join forces with Homo Sapiens to change their fate. Using the last source of energy, Homo Deus successfully opened a time portal and proceeded to send giant fighting machines, called Mecha, to the present world.

The fate of humanity is in your hands. Could you create the strongest Mechas and save the future?

Become the Mech Master!

## **Our Motivation Behind Mech Master / Why We Made Mech Master**

Combining giant robots and NFT into a game is like the best idea ever. And for the best idea, we need the best team.

We \(Icetea\) are a team of experts and highly skilled individuals all across the country, who come together for one mission only - creating this incredible Mecha game for everyone. We want you to experience the world of Mech Master that we have envisioned for a long time, a world where you can command a whole giant Mecha army to fight for humanity. They are YOUR Mechas, and there’s proof of that.
